# Coding Patterns for Competitive Programming

Master essential patterns used in coding competitions and technical interviews.

## What are Coding Patterns?

Coding patterns are reusable problem-solving strategies that work for multiple types of problems. Learning these patterns helps you recognize problem structures and apply proven solutions quickly.

## Patterns Covered

### 01. Two Pointers
Use two pointers to traverse arrays/strings from different directions to solve problems efficiently.

**Best for:**
- Finding pairs in sorted arrays
- Container with most water
- Palindrome validation
- Merging sorted arrays

### 02. Sliding Window
Maintain a window of elements and slide it across the data structure to find optimal substrings/subarrays.

**Best for:**
- Maximum/minimum subarray problems
- Longest substring without repeating characters
- Permutation & anagram problems
- Fixed-size window calculations

### 03. Binary Search
Efficiently search in sorted arrays by dividing search space in half.

**Best for:**
- Searching in sorted arrays
- Finding boundaries (first/last occurrence)
- Rotated array search
- Search space optimization

### 04. DFS & BFS
Graph traversal patterns for exploring nodes in various orders.

**Best for:**
- Tree/graph traversal
- Connected components
- Shortest path (BFS)
- Topological sorting
- Backtracking problems

### 05. Dynamic Programming
Build solutions from smaller subproblems with memoization/tabulation.

**Best for:**
- Optimization problems
- Counting problems
- Value maximization
- Sequence-based problems

## How to Use This Section

Each pattern folder contains:
- **README.md** - Pattern explanation with **toggleable code examples** in all languages
- **Reference files** - Full implementations for deeper study (examples.js, examples.py, examples.java)
- **Templates** - Quick-start code snippets

### 🎯 Quick Start
1. Visit any pattern folder (01-two-pointers, 02-sliding-window, etc.)
2. Open the **README.md** file
3. **Toggle between languages** to see the code in your preferred language
4. Click links to view full reference implementations
5. Copy examples to practice

## Learning Strategy

1. **Understand** the pattern concept
2. **Analyze** example problems
3. **Solve** practice problems
4. **Identify** similar problems
5. **Build muscle memory** through repetition

## Problem Recognition

When you encounter a problem:
1. Identify the data structure (array, string, tree, graph)
2. Determine the goal (find, maximize, count, etc.)
3. Recognize the pattern
4. Apply the template solution
5. Optimize if needed
